- **Delivery Tasks**: "[School Name]: Delivery"
- **Installation Tasks**: "[School Name]: Installation"
- **Issue Resolution Tasks**: "[School Name]: Issue Resolution"
- **Revisit Tasks**: "[School Name]: Revisit"

Each task includes:

- Resource assignments
- Completion percentages
- Trustee zone information
- Notes and issues

## Filtering and Visualization

### Managing Large Datasets

When working with large numbers of tasks (over 50), consider these approaches:

1. **Time-Based Filtering**: Focus on upcoming tasks (Next 30 Days)
2. **Category Focus**: View only specific categories (e.g., only Installation)
3. **School Selection**: Use the search function to find specific schools
4. **Zone Filtering**: View one zone at a time
5. **Status Filtering**: Separate completed and incomplete tasks

### Visualization Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Keep completion percentages current
- **Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistent school naming conventions
- **Note Important Information**: Use the Notes field for critical information
- **Color Coding**: Tasks are automatically color-coded by category
- **Monthly View**: For high-level planning, use the Monthly Task Distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Chart Not Displaying**: Too many tasks may cause display issues. Use more filtering to reduce the number of displayed tasks.

- **Mixed Data Types**: If you see errors about comparing strings and integers, your Trustee_Zone data might have mixed formats. The application should handle this automatically.

- **Date Format Issues**: Ensure dates in any imported CSVs use standard formats (YYYY-MM-DD).

- **Missing Schools**: Check that school names in different sheets match exactly.

- **Performance Issues**: Large datasets may cause slowdowns. Use focused filtering for better performance.

### Data Backup

The application automatically saves data to a `gantt_data.csv` file in your working directory. This file is loaded when you restart the application.

For backup purposes:
1. Use the Download feature to save a CSV copy
2. Store backup copies in a secure location
3. Consider date-stamping exports (e.g., ups_gantt_2023-05-15.csv)
